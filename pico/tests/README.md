# Test Files

This folder contains testing and validation files for the sensor system.

## Files:
- `system_test_v2.py` - Comprehensive system testing (current system)
- `sensor_quality_test_v2.py` - Sensor accuracy validation (current system)  
- `triple_check_verification_v2.py` - Multi-stage system verification (current system)
- `distance_speed_test.py` - Distance sensor performance testing
- `i2c_frequency_test.py` - I2C communication frequency testing
- `sensor_calibration.py` - Sensor calibration procedures

## Usage:
Run these tests to validate sensor performance, calibrate hardware, and verify system functionality before deployment. Files with "_v2" are updated for the current improved code structure.

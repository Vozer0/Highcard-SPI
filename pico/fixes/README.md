# OLED Display Debugging Files

This folder contains debugging and fix files that were used to resolve OLED display issues.

## **Problem Solved:**
The OLED was displaying dots instead of readable text due to I2C communication timeouts.

## **Solution Found:**
Changed I2C frequency from 100kHz to 200kHz in `oled_display.py`

## **Files in this folder:**

### **oled_i2c_fix.py** ‚≠ê **THE SOLUTION**
- Tests different I2C frequencies to find working one
- **This file found that 200kHz works for this display**
- Use this if you have I2C timeout issues again

### **oled_debug.py**
- Comprehensive OLED testing suite
- Tests fill, pixels, text, contrast, etc.
- Useful for general OLED troubleshooting

### **main_debug.py**
- Simple wrapper to run the debug tests
- Shows what to look for during testing

### **oled_targeted_debug.py**
- Focused debug for the "dots instead of solid fill" issue
- Tests manual pixel filling vs fill() function

### **oled_fixes.py**
- Various attempted fixes for display rendering
- Tests different initialization sequences
- Tests framebuffer manipulation

## **If you have OLED problems again:**
1. First try `oled_i2c_fix.py` to check I2C communication
2. Then try `oled_debug.py` for comprehensive testing
3. The other files contain various experimental fixes

## **Current Working Configuration:**
- I2C Frequency: 200kHz
- Display: 128x64 SSD1306
- Pins: SDA=8, SCL=9
- Address: 0x3C
